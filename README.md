# M-CLAUD: MultiCloud Log & MITRE ATT&CK Customizable Unified Dashboard

## 1.Our Goal

Integrated analysis of log data generated in a multi-cloud environment to identify security threats based on MITRE ATT&CK, and provision of customized information using RBAC to enable real-time monitoring and response by users and administrators according to their security needs

## 2. Main Idea
- Real-time monitoring and detailed analysis of security threats occurring in various multi-cloud environments in conjunction with MITRE ATT&CK tactics and technologies, and providing the acquired security threats to the user
- Users and administrators can directly customize the dashboard view to selectively observe and manage analysis results for high-priority items according to their individual needs

## 3. Proposed System Operation Prcoess
- For the proposed system, the processes of 'automated log collection and structuring', 'MITRE ATT&CK-based security threat analysis', 'RBAC-based security data access control', and 'customized dashboard configuration according to USER request' are performed.

## 4.  Advantages of the Proposed System
- Users can gradually customize the dashboard by sequentially selecting the desired options without having to specify all the settings at once from the beginning
- Since each layer can be managed independently, it is easy to maintain by minimizing conflicts with other layers even when updating a specific layer
