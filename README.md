# ATT-LAS: ATT&CK-based Multi-Cloud Log Analytics for Scenario Prediction Dashboard

## 1.Our Goal

Integrated analysis of log data generated in a multi-cloud environment to identify security threats based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Log data is normalized into STIX format, enabling detection through predefined threat rules. Detected TTPs are used with a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to predict potential attack scenarios. A real-time dashboard is developed for intuitive monitoring and management of threats across cloud platforms.

## 2. Main Idea
- Real-time monitoring and detailed analysis of security threats occurring in various multi-cloud environments in conjunction with MITRE ATT&CK tactics and technologies, and providing the acquired security threats to the user
- Beyond merely detecting ongoing threats, the system enables proactive threat recognition by modeling potential future attack stages as scenario-based progressions.

## 3.  Advantages of the Proposed System
- Users can gain a unified view of security threats across AWS, GCP, Azure through normalized log data in a single platform
- Users can proactively understand and prepare for potential attack paths thanks to automated threat mapping and scenario prediction using MITRE ATT&CK and GNN
- Dashboard allows users to focus on what matters most to them, enabiling efficient, real-time monitoring and response
